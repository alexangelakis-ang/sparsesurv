Description: Tools for fitting, forecasting, and early detection of outbreaks in
    sparse surveillance count time series. Supports negative binomial (NB),
    self-exciting NB, GARMA-NB, zero-inflated NB (ZINB), self-exciting ZINB,
    GARMA-ZINB, and hurdle formulations. Climatic and environmental covariates
    can be included in the regression component and/or the zero-modified components.
    Includes outbreak-detection algorithms for NB, ZINB, and hurdle models, with
    utilities for prediction and diagnostics.
